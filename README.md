# What Drives the Price of a Car?

## Executive Summary
**Objective**: The project aims to analyze a dataset from Kaggle containing car information to determine factors influencing a car's price. The goal is to offer clear recommendations to a used car dealership on what consumers value in a used car.

**Key Findings**: The price of used cars is influenced by various factors: a clean title is essential, with each year of age reducing the price. Manufacturer and condition also play significant roles, with each unit increase in manufacturer index and condition index decreasing the price. Additionally, the number of cylinders increases the price, while odometer reading, transmission type (mostly automatic), and rear-wheel drive (rwd) configuration also impact pricing.

**Recommendation**: Focus on acquiring high-value brands and adjust pricing strategies based on age, mileage, and fuel type.

**Framework/Methodology**: For this task, I am employing the CRISP-DM framework, which is structured into six key phases.
