# CarPricing
The goal of the project is to explore a dataset from kaggle that contains information on 426K cars. Our aim is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. Based on the analysis, I will provide  clear recommendations to the client, a used car dealership - as to what consumers value in a used car.
